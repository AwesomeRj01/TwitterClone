    <string name="kasol_story">kasol trip started with me and ayushman leaving from his house for the isbt bus terminal and frankly we were really not on time. we reached there just 5 mins before but there was one belief not that we will reach on time but one of our friend would be more late than us. And yes the faith we had in our friends was right, adtiya and piyush indeed arrived after us. So we now kept our bags in the luggage area and then had a fun discussion with everyone and clicked a hell lot of photos, the start of the trip was really fun and it really promised that my first trip with friends and without my parents will be more than fun and a lot of memories. In no time we reached murthal, one stop destination of night stays for truck drivers, and what a posh area that was full of lights looked like a buzzy place, our bus eventually stopped at a dhaba, which was more like a 3 or 4 star hotel, we had kachoris made by adityas mom and boy they were delicious, with this brief break we boarded the bus again, and now the bus was quite some of us were awake whereas some slept listening to music. At about 2 in the night we reached chandigarh and it looked like a city in another country, so well planned from the looks of it, and genuinely looked like 2 tier city, though we didnt stopped anywhere there so we couldnt deboard there and the bus continued its journey which now started to enter mountains and this journey was indeed really beautiful</string>
